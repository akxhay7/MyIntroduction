Hello everyone! Myself Akshay Puthiya Valappil, a final year CSE student at Vimal Jyothi Engineering College. 
I chose this course because of my passion to technologies and also because of the job scope underlying in this technolgy sector.
Apart from these, I'm more interested in planes and cars and kind of am an aviation enthusiast. 
One important fact about me is that I always try to achieve things that I'm more interested with full dedication and I'm good at facing hurdles and thriving through them.
Thankyou!
